# SmartBin  

## Note: this code is from 2024, This code may contain bugs or vulnerabilities.
SmartBin is an **innovative smart trash bin** designed to automatically detect whether waste is **organic** or **inorganic**. This project is part of a **P5 initiative**, aiming to promote smart waste management using sensor technology.  

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: Classifies waste as organic or inorganic automatically.  
- ✅ **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects the presence of waste near the bin.  
- ✅ **Capacitive Sensor**: Identifies organic material.  
- ✅ **Inductive Sensor**: Detects inorganic or metallic items.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Hardware**:  
  - Proximity Capacitive Sensor  
  - Inductive Capacitive Sensor  
  - Arduino UNO R3
  - ESP8226
- **Software**:  
  - Arduino
  - PHP
  - JavaScript (for web)

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The **ultrasonic sensor** detects when an object approaches the bin.  
2. **Capacitive and inductive sensors** analyze the object to determine whether it is **organic** or **inorganic**.  
3. The system processes the data and sorts or signals accordingly. 
4. System send the data to web using websocket 

## 📌 Use Case  
This project can be implemented in **schools, public areas, or offices** to encourage **smart and sustainable waste disposal**.
